# EC601Project1 - Building 3D scenes from 2D images

## 1. Introduction
3D reconstruction technique has been widely used in games, movies, mapping, positioning, navigation, autopilot, VR / AR, industrial manufacturing, and consumer products fields. Real-time 3D reconstruction is an inevitable trend to achieve better interaction and perception. 
Computer vision must move towards integrating 3D reconstruction and recognition. Therefore, building 3D scenes from 2D images is an essential problem in computer vision and other imaging applications.
